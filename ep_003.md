# Episode Three: Browser Button and Default Pop-Up

Third on the API checklist in [the migration guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/migrating_to_manifest_v3) (yes, I am skipping background pages for now, because they are complicated):

> Are you using the `browser_action` or `page_action` property in `manifest.json`? Replace with `action`.

Here's our V2 manifest, which adds `browser_action` so a default title shows on browser button hover and a pop-up window appears on click:

````
{
  "version": "0.0.103",
  "name": "Baseline",
  "description": "Manifest V2 Baseline",
  "permissions": ["*://*/*"],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_title": "MV2Baseline",
    "default_popup": "html/popup.html"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "js": ["js/content.js"],
      "matches": ["*://*/*"]
    }
  ],
  "manifest_version": 2
}
````

Here's our tiny pop-up window for Manifest V2, saved as `ep_003/v2/html/popup.html`:

````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Pop-Up from Manifest V2</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Manifest V2 Baseline</h1>
  </body>
</html>
````

Here's our V3 manifest, with our `default_title` and `default_popup` in the new `action` field:

````
{
  "version": "0.0.103",
  "name": "Test",
  "description": "Manifest V3 Test",
  "host_permissions": ["*://*/*"],
  "action": {
    "default_title": "MV3Test",
    "default_popup": "html/popup.html"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "js": ["js/content.js"],
      "matches": ["*://*/*"]
    }
  ],
  "manifest_version": 3
}
````

Here's our tiny pop-up window for Manifest V3, saved as `ep_003/v3/html/popup.html`:

````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Pop-Up from Manifest V3</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Manifest V3 Test</h1>
  </body>
</html>
````

Load by dragging `ep_003/v2` and `ep_003/v3` into `chrome://extensions`.  As far as I know, both of these should still run in Chrome Canary.

### Results

- In `chrome://extensions` or `about:blank` only the baseline version will show an active browser button.  Unless this is a side effect of the error noted below, this is smart and will save us lots of trouble later.
- In tabs with pages loaded -- don't forget to reload if you've just installed the extension! -- both buttons will be active.
- Only the baseline version will show the default title or load the pop-up window.

### What's Going On?

- Under the Errors button (which we've started to ignore, because all it usually contains is that warning about the maximum currently-supported manifest version being 2) you'll find this:

````'action' requires trunk channel or newer, but is is the canary channel.````

... with a bunch of yellow highlight over your `action` object.
