# Episode Four:  Executing Scripts

Further down the API checklist in [the migration guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/migrating_to_manifest_v3):

> Are you currently using `chrome.tabs.executeScript({code: '...'})`, `eval()`, or `new Function()` in background contexts or content scripts?

Of course not, because we had to quit doing that in Firefox ages ago to get listed on addons.mozilla.org.  Getting an additional script to execute in the content window when requested via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` seems like a fine way to ease into background scripting, however, so let's do it.  First, our baseline:

## Baseline

Here's our [V2 manifest](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_004/v2/manifest.json), which adds a background script and requests tab permission, so we can send messages and execute a content script:

````
{
  "version": "0.0.104",
  "name": "Baseline",
  "description": "Manifest V2 Baseline",
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["js/background.js"]
  },
  "permissions": ["tabs", "*://*/*"],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "js": ["js/content.js"],
      "matches": ["*://*/*"]
    }
  ],
  "manifest_version": 2
}
````

Our [content script](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_004/v2/js/content.js) writes a message to the console and asks the background for more:

```
console.log("Content script has loaded via Manifest V2.");

// send a message to the background requesting an additional script
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  cmd: "runLogic"
});
```

Our [background script](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_004/v2/js/background.js) listens for messages and responds to requests for our business logic:

```
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  console.log("Message received!");
  console.log("request: ", request);
  console.log("sender: ", sender);
  if (request.cmd === "runLogic") {
    chrome.tabs.executeScript(sender.tab.id, {
      file: "js/logic.js"
    });
  }
});
```

Our [business logic](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_004/v2/js/logic.js) does nothing but let us know it's running:

```
console.log("A script has run from chrome.tabs.executeScript via Manifest V2.");
```

### Results

Drag `ep_004/v2/` into `chrome://extensions`.  Note that we now have a background view to inspect; click to do so, and then switch to the console tab.  Then open a fresh tab and load a page.  In the background console you should see something like this:

````
Message received!
request: {cmd: "runLogic"}
sender: {id: "deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef", [other stuff here]}
````

Inspect the page you just opened.  In the Console tab you should see something like this: 

````
Content script has loaded via Manifest V3. content.js
A script has run from chrome.tabs.executeScript via Manifest V2. logic.js
````

## Manifest V3 

Duplicating everything and changing the manifest version to 3 will get you a gruesome pop-up error:

````
Failed to load extension
File ~/ep_004/v3/
Error The "background.scripts" key cannot be used with manifest_version 3. Use the "background.service_worker" key instead.
Could not load manifest.
````

Well, crap. Looks like we need to migrate to service workers sooner rather than later.  Changing our `background` property in [our manifest](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_004/v3/manifest.json) to `service_worker` (being careful to make this a string and not an array!) looks like the right first thing to try:

````
{
  "version": "0.0.104",
  "name": "Test",
  "description": "Manifest V3 Test",
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "js/background.js"
  },
  "permissions": ["tabs"],
  "host_permissions": ["*://*/*"],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "js": ["js/content.js"],
      "matches": ["*://*/*"]
    }
  ],
  "manifest_version": 3
}
````

Everything else seems like it ought to be fine.

### Results

- When we load or reload the extension (by dragging `/ep_004/v3` into `chrome://extensions`) we're not seeing an inspectable view under the extension. That's worrisome.

- In the content tab we're seeing the message from `content.js` ("Content script has loaded via Manifest V3") but nothing else.  It feels like the background script isn't executing?

### What's Going On Here?

Per the docs:

> Are you using background pages? Replace background.page or background.scripts with background.service_worker in manifest.json. Note that the service_worker field takes a string, not an array of strings. 

Check.

> Remove background.persistent from manifest.json.

Was never using this; check.

> Update background scripts to adapt to the service worker execution context.

Ohhhh, okay. Thanks!
